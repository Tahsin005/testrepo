Tic Tac Toe User Manual
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe! This classic game is played on a 3x3 grid and 
the goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row, 
either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Here's how to play:

The game is played by two players. Player 1 will be X and Player 2 will be O.

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

Players take turns to make their moves. Player 1 (X) goes first.

To make a move, enter the corresponding number for the position on the board. 
Each position is represented by a number from 1 to 9 as shown below:
                 1 | 2 | 3
                ___|___|___
                   |   |
                 4 | 5 | 6
                ___|___|___
                   |   |
                 7 | 8 | 9
                   |   |

For example, if you want to place your mark in the top-right corner, enter 3.

After each move, the updated board will be displayed.

The game continues until one of the players gets three of their marks in a row or there are no more empty positions on the board, resulting in a draw.

If a player wins, the game will display a congratulatory message and end.

If the game ends in a draw, it will display a message indicating a tie.
